     "description": "<p>Have you ever wondered how coding could become even more efficient? With GitHub Copilot, you can utilise the power of AI to generate code suggestions according to your specific context</p>\n    <h2 id='1'>Features of GitHub Copilot</h2> \n  <ul> \n   <li>GitHub Copilot uses an AI model trained on a large corpus of code from publicly available sources, including code on GitHub itself. This allows it to understand and generate programming patterns, functions, and entire classes.</li> \n   <li>It assists in writing new code and contributing to existing code. The tool can suggest complete methods, boilerplate code, tests, and even complex algorithms.</li>\n  </ul>"
